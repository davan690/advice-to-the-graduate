# Preface

I see you. I see a lot of you. Almost every day. You want to do quality research using sound statistical and other practices, but your training is minimal, and it might have even been a couple years since you last did anything substantial.  And while you want to do good analysis, any decent statistical effort will require a notable amount of programming, and you may have little to no programming experience. Furthermore, you may have been taught by people with no formal statistical, programming, data or other relevant training, which only compounds the problem.  So you don't know what you're doing, but you don't want anyone to notice.  In fact, you'd like to bluff your way to the point of giving presentations, publishing papers etc., all with the polish of a master.  

It's okay. Most of the others are in the same boat.

These are some thoughts, particularly for graduate students, but really any researcher in applied disciplines, on what they can do regarding statistical and programming basics to make their research efforts more efficient. The suggestions will have a strong eye toward balance.  I realize that if you wanted to be a statistician or computer programmer, you wouldn't be getting a degree in sociology, chemistry, ecology or whatever.

## Outline

### General

First we begin with some general things that can apply to statistics, programming, and possibly well beyond.  Concepts like compartmentalization, reproducibility, and so forth, many of which will not require any particular expertise, only practice.  Even so, their application can go a long way toward making research and statistical computing easier.

### Basic analysis and programming

After that we'll cover things that I think anyone doing research could benefit from, both statistically and in terms of programming.  For example, this will include iterative programming, coding style, and problems with common statistical practice.  Some might seem a little specific, but they generally won't take much effort to implement.

### Intermediate analysis and programming

The last part will regard some suggestions that get a taste for things and want to go further.  This section will be for those that want to do even more advanced programming and statistics, as well as more to present themselves and their work to others.







- Ash in your shoes
- Always use the old sense of the words
- Your third drink will lead you astray
- On the last day of your life, don't forget to die
- Don't believe in people who say it's all been done





Key ideas:


general: apply to stats/programming/research generally

- compartmentalization, get a book, reproducibility, simple to complex, focusing more on vis, embracing uncertainty but avoiding relativism, flexibility


basics: pretty much needed to understand basic stats and programming

-  a few concepts to get you far, loops, minimizing and maximizing, explanation vs. prediction, data processing, downplaying nhst, regularization, coding style, naming conventions, visualization basics


going further: for the really motivated

- functions, reusable code, debuggin' de bugaloos, building a brand


[^manova]: I'm still trying to figure out why MANOVA is being taught for any reason in 2017, but I know that it is.

[^spss_syntax]: Not that learning SPSS syntax would have been a good way to spend one's time.

[^punch]: I'm not kidding.  SPSS syntax was developed during the punch card mainframe era of the 1970s. The first release was actually 1968.  It has slightly more functionality now, though the graphics are about the same.

[^1984]: As long as you weren't a minority, ignored the economy, and didn't mind being taught to hide under your desk in case a nuclear bomb was dropped on your head.  I admit that this is a U.S. centric recollection.  I'm sure the Canadians were fine for example, though they didn't learn to flip their collars for a couple more years.

[^dmc]: Deloreans actually ceased production in 1983, but that was mostly because almost every household that could had purchased at least one and the market was exhausted.  The streets were literally cluttered with them, and many people would even leave them in parking lots with wings open, hoping someone would steal it.

[^lazer]: Insert Lazerhawk and/or Kavinsky here.

[^bestquote]: You may try, but you will never, *ever* find a better quote in all of statistics.  Also, it's generally expected that when uttered, those in earshot must snap at least twice and say 'Right on, daddy-o'.

[^efron79]: *Computers and the theory of statistics: thinking the unthinkable* B Efron **1979**.  Here is the abstract: This is a survey article concerning recent advances in certain areas of statistical theory, written for a mathematical audience with no background in statistics. The topics are chosen to illustrate a special point: how the advent of the high-speed computer has affected the development of statistical theory. The topics discussed include nonparametric methods, the jackknife, the bootstrap, cross-validation, error-rate estimation in discriminant analysis, robust estimation, the influence function, censored data, the EM algorithm, and Cox's likelihood function. The exposition is mainly by example, with only a little offered in the way of theoretical development.  <br><br> I'd be willing to bet one could change nothing but the date, give this at a conference for some applied disciplines, and no one would notice.

[^r4stats]: Despite what you may see in your discipline, this is an indisputable fact at this point.  Your discipline is not statistics, computer science or other fields driving methodological development.  Assuming that the common practice in an applied

[^mullet]: At least those with one like Kenny Powers from Eastbound & Down.

[^powergrad]: I've never understood the motivation behind faculty who request their graduate students do a power analysis. Want to know how many folks you need for your study? Here's the more appropriate question: *When* do you want to graduate?

[^nie]: Perhaps surprisingly, he did not subsequently claim to have invented R.
