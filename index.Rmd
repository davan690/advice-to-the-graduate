# Preface

I see you. I recognize you. I acknowledge your existence. Let's talk...

You want to do quality research using sound statistical and other practices, but your training is minimal, and it might have even been a couple years since you last did anything substantial.  And while you want to do good analysis, any decent statistical effort will require a notable amount of programming, and you may have little to no programming experience. Furthermore, you may have been taught by people with no formal statistical, programming, data or other relevant training, which only compounds the problem.  So you don't know what you're doing, but you don't want anyone to notice.  In fact, you'd like to bluff your way to the point of giving presentations, publishing papers etc., all with the polish of a master.  

It's okay. Most of the others are in the same boat.

These are some thoughts, particularly for graduate students, but really any researcher in applied disciplines, on what they can do regarding statistical and programming basics to make their research efforts more efficient, more in-depth, and in the end, hopefully more fun too. The suggestions will have a strong eye toward balance.  I realize that if you wanted to be a statistician or computer programmer, you wouldn't be getting a degree in sociology, chemistry, ecology, or whatever.  I also know that many of you can go much further with statistical computing than you think.

Note that the following is oriented toward the vast majority of those who do research that will involve some form of statistical analysis.  While I know for a fact that some of it could even help those doing other kinds of research, it will have less to say to them.  These thoughts are based on the many issues I've seen among many graduate students, faculty, and staff across a wide range of disciplines, whom I've taught, consulted, and worked with.



## Outline

### General

First we begin with some general things that can apply to statistics, programming, and possibly well beyond.  Concepts will be introduced like compartmentalization, reproducibility, and so forth, many of which will not require any particular expertise, only practice.  Even so, their application can go a long way toward making research and statistical computing easier.

### Basic analysis and programming

After that we'll cover things that I think anyone doing research could benefit from, both statistically and in terms of programming.  For example, this will include iterative programming, coding style, and problems with common statistical practice.  Some might seem a little specific, but they generally won't take much effort to implement.

### Intermediate analysis and programming

The last part will regard some suggestions for those that get a taste for analysis and computing and want to go further.  This section will be for those that want to do even more advanced programming and statistics, as well as more to present themselves and their work to others.


## Goal

The hope here is to basically inform about those things that you won't be told about or spend much time on in usual training circumstances.  You may get a sense of some of it, but, for example, probably most applied statistics courses don't even cover visualization, basic programming principles (i.e. beyond getting a statistical result), or how to organize one's approach.  This means that many dislike the enterprise, because so much time is wasted doing tedious things no one would like to do, instead of exploring ideas through data.  Incorporating just a few of these ideas and practices in your workflow can go a long way to make statistical computing a lot more fun.
