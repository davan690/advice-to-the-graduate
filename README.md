# Advice to the graduate

These are some thoughts, particularly for graduate students, but really any researcher in applied disciplines, on what they can do regarding statistical and programming basics to make their research efforts more efficient. The suggestions will have a strong eye toward balance.  I realize that if you wanted to be a statistician or computer programmer, you wouldn't be getting a degree in sociology, chemistry, ecology etc.


Topics include:

- How to get better at the statistics *you need*
- Why you need to learn how to program
- How to be more efficient at both
- Better Visualization
- Reproducible research practices
- Communication products
