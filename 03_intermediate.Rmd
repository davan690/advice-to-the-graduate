# Part III: One Last Caress

This section is for those who get the bug, and actually find they enjoy programming and analysis, or simply want to continue expanding their toolbox to do better analysis.  It'll outline some good things to be aware of, or skills to start obtaining.

## Analysis

Once you get the GLM basics, there are some common extensions to consider.

- Beyond GLM but standard statistical
    - clustered data
    - spatiotemporal situations
    - nonlinear relationships (additive models as a starting point)

- Dimension Reduction/Latent variable models
    - Factor analysis and related
    - Other

- Matrix basics

## Programming

You'll always be able to go further in programming, if for no other reason than the fact that you weren't taught basic programming skills in the first place.  The more you know, the easier things will continue to come, the more data you can explore, the better visualizations you can produce, the speed at which you can do practically everything will increase,  etc.

- Writing functions
- Debugging
- Vectorization
- Profiling
- HPC
    - Unix

## Visualization

For those that want to go down the rabbit hole regarding visualization, this document can perhaps serve as a starting point. The text that is of a contrast ratio relative to the background that would satisfy some of the more strict [web accessibility standards](http://www.webaxe.org/color-contrast-tools/).  This includes the color coded text, though those are not quite as stringent. I use my own css files to implement these through the document.  In addition, the colors in the plots are evenly spaced and would be distinguishable for those with even rare forms of color-blindness.  You'll also notice there are no gridlines, which are completely unnecessary when you can obtain the specific values by hovering over the plot[^gridlines].

Beyond adding complexity and appropriate coloration, you also want to think interactively.  Interactivity is key in this day and age, and should be a fundamental part of your visualization arsenal. It probably won't be long before it's an expected part of scientific visualization, assuming the journals get out of the way.  The nice thing is, you can always start with an interactive plot, and take a snapshot for the publication, keeping the interactive plot as supplementary material.

[^gridlines]: Gridlines are unnecessary anyway in my opinion. First, can you really not tell roughly where the values are without them?  Second, they often convey a level of precision that is not inherent in the data.  Third, and most important, they're ugly.  This goes for their use in tables as well.
