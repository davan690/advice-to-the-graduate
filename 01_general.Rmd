# Part I: Universal Truths & Cycles

## Compartmentalization

## Reproducibility

Assume that at some point you'll have to leave your analysis, code, document etc. behind. Maybe it's just time off, maybe it's a health issue, who knows?  But think about when you come back.  Will you know what you've done?


## Get a book

If you decide on a particular analytical route for your thesis or dissertation, get a book on it. Buy it, check it out whatever you need to, but have a handy reference for the thing you're about to spend an inordinate time on, possibly with not having ever dealt with it before.  It just makes sense.  Even if it's a little more technical, remember that you're about to spend a lot of time in this area, and that's the sort of thing you'll need.


## Complexify later



## Much of your brain is devoted to visual processing

First, assume others' brains are not so different from yours, then take advantage of it.


## Embracing uncertainty but avoiding relativism



## Flexibility

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow... or it can *crash*. Be water, my friend.

## Your work isn't that important

Go out and do something else.  See a show, get some exercise, go to a museum, get drunk, whatever you need to do to not think about this esoteric part of intellectual endeavor that in the end 99.9% of the world could care less about.  The world will keep spinning I assure you.
