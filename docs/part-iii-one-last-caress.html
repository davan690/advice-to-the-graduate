<h1>Part III: One Last Caress</h1>
<p>This section is for those who get the bug, and actually find they enjoy programming and analysis, or simply want to continue expanding their toolbox to do better analysis. It’ll outline some good things to be aware of, or skills to start obtaining.</p>
<div id="analytical-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Analytical</h2>
<div id="beyond-glm" class="section level3">
<h3>Beyond GLM</h3>
<p>After standard regression and classification techniques, there are some common extensions to consider. However, I would suggest you first learn an advanced technique that is commonly used in your discipline. Beyond that, some more common statistical models that take a next step in complexity are those that deal with clustered data (mixed models), nonlinear relationships (e.g. additive models), and those that deal with space or time (possibly both). Be aware that the additional complexity brings with it a fuzziness, such that it becomes difficult to use standard null hypothesis testing. This is not a drawback by any stretch, but it will be difficult for you if you’ve come to rely on p-values as your primary means of interpreting models.</p>
</div>
<div id="dimension-reductionlatent-variable-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Dimension Reduction/Latent variable models</h3>
<p>In the previous section we noted that one should at least be familiar with why you would use things like PCA and factor analysis. For the more motivated, these should be standard tools in your toolbox. I would specifically suggest PCA, standard factor analysis, latent dirichlet allocation, and model-based clustering methods (i.e. mixture models).</p>
</div>
<div id="matrix-basics" class="section level3">
<h3>Matrix basics</h3>
<p>There are two reasons to know just a smidge of matrix operations- speeding up your code and understanding methodological presentations. As far as the amount, you probably don’t need any more than is commonly found in the appendices of some statistical texts, and being familiar with those operations in your programming language of choice. With programming, while others are writing verbose loops, you’ll be speedily one-lining the same operations in <span class="emph">vectorized</span> fashion. Furthermore, when you’re wanting to learn new techniques, such knowledge will allow for more rapid acquisition.</p>

<div id="the-bayes-way" class="section level3">
<h3>The Bayes Way</h3>
<p>Bayesian analysis is commonplace, and requires no more justification than standard techniques. If you don’t see it regularly applied in your field, it is your discipline that hasn’t been keeping up with things. <em>You</em>, on the other hand, should feel comfortable using it in lieu of any other analysis you would, starting with regression. A Bayesian regression requires no more effort to explain than a standard regression, <em>because it is just a standard regression</em>, albeit estimated differently.</p>
<p>The benefits of the Bayesian approach are many. To begin, you get probabilities and intervals that make sense, and don’t require some notion of ‘infinitely repeated experiments’ and backward logic. Any statistic you can calculate from a model will automatically have an interval estimate. For example, in a standard regression you’d not only get an ‘adjusted’ R<sup>2</sup> by default<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>, you’d also have an interval estimate for it. The Bayesian approach works well in cases where you have small samples, possessing built-in <span class="emph">regularization</span> to guard against overfitting, allowing you to explore more fully your data even when you don’t have much of it. For more complicated models, the p-values and intervals are no more difficult to acquire than usual, unlike the traditional setting where it seems that for many models beyond the GLM setting approximations are required (e.g. mixed models, generalized additive models).</p>
<p>In general the Bayesian approach will give you more flexibility and better assessment of uncertainty, and can definitely be your default modeling approach. For an introduction to Bayesian analysis, see my document <a href="https://m-clark.github.io/bayesian-basics">here</a>.</p>

<div id="machine-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>In this day and age, any applied discipline that teaches a semester course in statistical analysis should have a week of it devoted to an overview of machine learning. The only reason you may not see it practiced much in your discipline is due to 1. your discipline never teaches it, or 2. people outside of your discipline are doing the interesting things for your discipline, and publishing elsewhere. I can tell you however, that it is useful, you may need to employ it some day, or at the very least, you shouldn’t ignore articles using it because you don’t know what they’re talking about conceptually.</p>
<p>Data can be big, complex, or both, and there are techniques to handle it if so. If you don’t know about them, you may be inclined to do some very silly things to coerce the situation to one you know, which is precisely the wrong thing to do. If your discipline doesn’t cover it in any fashion, do a workshop, look online for some exercises, or simply schedule some time to chat with someone who does know about them. With tools like R and Python, the difficulty will <em>not</em> be running the models.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>You’ll always be able to go further in programming, if for no other reason than the fact that you likely weren’t taught basic programming skills in the first place. The more you know, the easier things will continue to come, the more data you can explore, the better visualizations you can produce, the speed at which you can do practically everything will increase, etc.</p>
<div id="keyboard" class="section level3">
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>There are things you can do. And there are things you can do because you finished that other stuff an hour ago. One of the main benefits of an IDE are all the keyboard shortcuts that can save you a lot of time compared to point and clicking. Unfortunately, keyboards on many laptops don’t have the type of keyboard those shortcuts assume, and some operating systems seem to not be aware that keyboards can have over 100 keys.</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Writing functions</h3>
<p>One of the first things you can do to take your programming further is to write your own functions. One of the tenets of programming is <span class="emph">DRY</span>, or <em>don’t repeat yourself</em>. Anytime you’re copying what is essentially the same code violates that principle. Writing your own functions can help you avoid doing so, and can be extremely simple. For example, the following takes two variables, divides one by the other and multiplies by 100 (i.e. creates a percentage).</p>
<p>R</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">percent &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="cf">function</span>(x, y) {
  <span class="dv">100</span><span class="op">*</span>x<span class="op">/</span>y
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Python</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> percent(x, y):
  <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">100</span><span class="op">*</span>x<span class="op">/</span>y</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want, you can now add additional complexity to make it do more (e.g. add rounding, formatting). Furthermore, you can reuse the function anywhere you like.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of writing functions, you’ll find yourself doing so regularly, because it simply makes things much easier than constantly repeating yourself. In addition, you may find other functions available in packages do <em>almost</em> everything you want, and you’ll be able to tweak their code to create a function that does <em>exactly</em> what you want.</p>
</div>
<div id="debugging" class="section level3">
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p><span class="emph">Debugging</span> is the process of finding errors or issues in code. If you are writing your own functions, debugging will allow you to course through the function line by line, inspecting the output created, and fix any errors. Even if it’s not your own function, debugging can allow you to find out why some function is spitting an esoteric error message at you.</p>
<p>More generally, the <em>concept</em> of debugging is essential to scientific endeavor. Data, models, and theories come with bugs too, and you should have a similar mindset when approaching them as you would problematic code, inspecting them piece by piece and improving them whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
</div>
<div id="iterative-programming-vectorization" class="section level3">
<h3>Iterative Programming &amp; Vectorization</h3>
<p>One of the more popular blogs on R-Bloggers for a long time was ‘Writing your first <span class="emph">for loop</span>’. The reason is that iterative programming is a core programming technique, particularly in data science. It is so common that you’ll want to apply some function to, for example, every row or column, that not knowing how to do so in an efficient fashion will severely hamper your coding practice.</p>
<p>Some programming languages have even more efficiency to be gained through <span class="emph">vectorization</span>, where operations are done on vectors rather than proceeding element by element. For example, in R, between core functions being vectorized, matrix operations, the <span class="func">apply</span> family of functions, and packages like <span class="pack">purrr</span>, I almost never have to write an explicit loop, and code runs much faster. With some languages you may find some that suggest vectorization will not produce much speed gain. They are wrong, if only because it will take you less time to write the code. Cleaner and clearer code is always desirable too.</p>
</div>
<div id="high-performance-computing" class="section level3">
<h3>High Performance Computing</h3>
<p>At some point your data or models may require more resources than your computer can provide. Research universities provide cluster computing for such cases, but now anyone can use services such as those provided by Amazon or Microsoft as well. Knowing the basics of <span class="emph">parallelization</span>, the cluster computing environment, and related tools will be necessary in such cases. However, even your own computer comes with multiple cores that you can take advantage, so you should be able to use the tools of your language to do that. <em>Any</em> iterative process in which the iterations are independent can potentially benefit from parallelization.</p>
<p>When speed becomes an issue, you’ll want to also be familiar with code <span class="emph">profiling</span>. Profiling allows you to assess where in your code bottlenecks occur, which you may then rework to produce faster results. However, this comes with the following caveat: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Code can be relatively slow but still good enough, and it’s important to balance computing vs. programming time.</p>

<h3>Visualization &amp; Presentation</h3>
<p>In a <a href="part-ii-perfect-sound-forever.html#visualization">previous section</a>, we talked about how a good visualization will take complex relationships and make them easier to understand, and in general, it will require some effort to pull off a good one. Beyond that, you also want to think interactively. Interactivity is key to visualization in this day and age, and should be a fundamental part of your visualization arsenal, especially since interactive forms of traditional plots are as easy to produce as the traditional ones. It probably won’t be long before it’s an expected part of scientific visualization, assuming the journals get out of the way. The nice thing is, you can always start with an interactive plot, and take a snapshot for the publication, keeping the interactive plot as supplementary material. Adding interactivity can add even more dimensions to a single visualization.</p>
<p>For those that really want to go down the rabbit hole regarding visualization, there’s always more to consider, and this document can perhaps serve as a starting point. The text is of a contrast ratio relative to the background that would satisfy some of the more strict <a href="http://www.webaxe.org/color-contrast-tools/">web accessibility standards</a>. This includes the color coded text, though those are not quite as stringent. I use my own CSS files to implement these throughout the document. In addition, the colors in the plots are evenly spaced and would be distinguishable for those with even rare forms of color-blindness. You’ll also notice there are no gridlines, which are completely unnecessary when you can obtain the specific values by hovering over the plot<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>.</p>

<div id="engaging-the-web" class="section level3">
<h3>Engaging the web</h3>
<p>If you do enough data analysis you’ll eventually need to acquire some data directly from the web, possibly in some raw form (e.g. text) that will require additional processing. Whether this will be easy or difficult unfortunately will not be up to you, but rather to those developing the website(s) that house the data, and many actively make the data difficult to obtain<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>. However, you can make it easier on yourself by knowing some basic HTML and other aspects of server-client communication, which will also help your web-based presentations. Your browser even comes with tools to help you.</p>
<p>Scraping the web will involve using tools in ways you never have, and thus often take a lot of effort, especially the first attempt. However, the payoff is often worth it, especially when you can create a unique data set that no one previously had access to.</p>

<div id="version-control-basics" class="section level3">
<h3>Version control basics</h3>
<p><img src="img/octocat.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width=35%></p>
<p><span class="emph">Version control</span> is something you should be aware of even if you don’t use it beyond the things like Box drive. For decades now there have been what are called version control systems (VCS) for software development. And even if you don’t use formal a formal VCS, the concept of thinking of your <span class="emph">science as software development</span> will go a long way toward improving your scientific method.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> allow for complex development involving many developers and iterations of applications to come together in a way that allows one to more rapidly correct mistakes, branch off into exploratory endeavors, add new people to the project, etc. But you’re not a software developer you say. I say so what.</p>
<p>Consider a faculty member with several grad students working on different phases of multiple projects. These tools would potentially allow for much more seemless collaboration, where, for example on one project a student could be working on the visualization ‘branch’, another on the conference presentation, another may be correcting some data, and while the faculty is working on the write-up, and eventually all these pieces can be merged into a final product. If there is any issue found later, it is easy to revert back to the correct state and continue from that point. VCS are also typically hosted remotely, e.g. at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and so automatic backup is in place, and it also provides a potential way to have your work exposed to even more people. The latter is especially nice for students, who will usually want to be marketing themselves and their skills as much as possible. However the real benefit to using something like Git and GitHub, is that if you know others are going to see your code, you <em>will</em> write better code.</p>
<p>To get started with version control, I’d suggest creating an account on GitHub and going through the steps to create your first <span class="emph">repository</span>. A repository (repo) is merely a collection of scripts and files associated with a specific endeavor. For example, many R packages and Python modules can be found as a repo on GitHub. Your first repository can be used for anything, but at least one of your first should be used just to learn how to use Git. Don’t worry, you won’t be able to break anything.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you will write some code, then <span class="emph">push</span> what you have to the repo on the web server (e.g. GitHub). Likewise, if you don’t have the latest update, you can <span class="emph">pull</span> whatever is on the repository to your local machine. In its most basic form where there is only one contributor to a repo, i.e. <em>you</em>, using Git can be very easy, especially with an IDE like RStudio that allows you to, once Git is installed, use version control via a couple clicks. Other tools, e.g. GitKraken, can make the process more visual and efficient. In my opinion, one of the key benefits to using a public storehouse for your code is that someone else might see it. For me, this meant writing better code, and that alone is beneficial. For private endeavors there is BitBucket and GitLab, which work very similarly to GitHub. However, note that while they are not public, that doesn’t mean they are secure enough for your data purposes (e.g. HIPAA compliant). However, you can still do the work and just ignore files that are data as far as what you send to the repo.</p>
<p>The additional benefits to version control are peace of mind, knowing that you can always and easily revert to a previous state if needed, and the discipline of the practice itself. It requires requires a bit of a different mindset to think of your research projects in a similar way as one would with software development, but is extremely useful in terms of reproducibility. When you start thinking of your science and modeling as software development, one that goes through a potentially continual (and public) process of improvement, you’ll almost automatically avoid many of the problems associated with the so-called ‘crisis’ of reproducibility. People engaged in this aren’t having any crisis at all, their methods are open, their documents are infused with data. Journal outlets, as they are now, are impediments, not facilitators. ‘Articles’, if the term should even apply, should come with titles plus a version number, ready to be extended, improved, or <em>merely</em> replicated.</p>
</div>
<div id="publishing" class="section level3">
<h3>Publishing</h3>
<p>Assuming you have given up using MS Word and are actually interested in doing reproducible research, the next steps are getting used to using Markdown, CSS, and even basic HTML.</p>
<p>Markdown is actually easier to use than MS Word, as you don’t have to hunt for what to click to make something a header, or italics. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span class="fu"># Header</span>
<span class="fu">## Sub-header</span>

*italics*
  
- <span class="fl">item 1</span>
<span class="fl">- item 2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Sprinkled throughout are chunks of code.</p>
<pre><code>```{r myrchunk, echo=FALSE}
x = rnorm(100)
```</code></pre>
<p>This is just simple R code, and the option <code>echo=FALSE</code> means it won’t be visible in the document. However, I can then use the object <span class="objclass">x</span> anywhere else in the document.</p>
<p>The point is not to make a markdown document, but to ultimately convert it to HTML, PDF, or even MS Word (if you must). With RStudio this takes no effort on your part. There are tools for Jupyter notebooks also, and even Stata has finally started down this path. Now consider a code chunk that runs a regression model and a function that will convert the results to nice table. No copy-paste nonsense required, and likely no formatting even. Data changes? So will your table of results. Same goes for visualizations. There, I just saved you hours on your next write-up.</p>
<p>Beyond markdown, knowing a bit of CSS will allow you to customize your work. Learning CSS is trivial, the hard part is knowing what to change. For example, if you know a modicum of HTML, you’d know that headers are denoted with H, followed by a level. For example <code>h1</code> is a top-level header. In CSS, if we want to change something about those we’d do the following in a *.css file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css">h1, h2, h3, h4 <span class="kw">{</span>
  <span class="kw">color:</span> <span class="dt">red</span><span class="kw">;</span>
  <span class="kw">font-family:</span> Helvetica<span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above would change both the color and font of the first four levels of headers<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>. Very easy. The issue is knowing what the names of things are, and what options you can tweak. This will come with time, but as a first step, simply use the web developer tools in your browser to inspect webpages. This will show you what both the tags are and what options are applied to them.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, writing a good looking and reproducible documents will be your default. In addition, your document write-up can be part of your project/GitHub repo. You’ll be a better researcher, and those that know you’re using such tools will put greater trust in your results.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-sharing" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration &amp; Sharing</h3>
<p>Once your work gets going there are lots of ways to share it with your research group and beyond. R, Python, and others allow one to create interactive <span class="emph">notebooks</span>. The idea here is that someone else can run the code you give them and see the results within the document itself, and while you can do this with any script, it also is in the same markdown format, so could potentially be published to HTML or other format. In my opinion, these are most useful for instruction, otherwise one can use the standard markdown-esque approach.</p>
<p>Git and related tools were created specifically for teams working collaboratively on software projects. However, it’s not restricted to software. Research teams can use the same approach. For example, one could be working on descriptive statistics and writing up the methods section (mostly text, some stats), another working on the intro (only text), and another on the results (mostly stats), and do so all at the same time. At any point any of the individuals could compile the most recent version of the document without affecting others<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If you really get good at programming, you may want to make your own package that covers some functionality not readily available or just does something differently. You can then share this with the world so that they can use the tool you’ve created as well. This has become so easy, the current proliferation of packages, especially in the R world, just continues to skyrocket.</p>
<p>However, you may want to create a package for your project/team. It’d contain useful functions and documentation, adding to the reproducibility and reusability of your work. This might seem tedious, but the time saved on revise and resubmits alone would probably make up for it.</p>
